<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>


</ul><p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to any human-like intelligence demonstrated by computing technology.Capabilities of an AI machine include learning from examples and experience, object recognition, understanding and responding to language, etc. Common examples of AI would be Google maps, self-driving vehicles.<p><h2>RELEVANCE</h2><p>AI has been implemented in every facet in our daily lives, and as a result society has seen a dramatic increase in productivity. AI have taken over repetitive or dangerous tasks, freeing up the human workforce to focus on tasks that require creativity or empathy. We utilize AI without realizing - Google Maps, smart searching, etc. A.I. is still a relatively young concept, which is constantly evolving and improving by the day.<p><h2>IMPORTANCE</h2><p>Over the past years the intellect of AI has increased frequently, having the ability to help advance the human knowledge of this world by solving problems that may be too complex for humans. However, because humans give such technologies the ability of human-like minded/behaviours, this therefore allows AI to possess a moral standard. The catch to AI having moral standard is, these machines do not have value and so therefore no meaning, yes, AI are program to have the ability to show higher performances (when comparing to humans) or at least have similar attributes as humans however The differentiation between humans and AI lies in the value of life, understanding ethics and so therefore applying to life. human will, acting autonomously to provide reasons As for this, autonomous machines therefore challenge the philosophical view on the value/existence of humans.
