<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>


<h4><em>From a philosophical perspective, AI has been challenging the value and the existence an individual has held to define themselves as humans. because such a machine/computer has the ability to almost dictate its own progitives, this will cause a lot of problems as we see in this world today within us humans, because we are living up to or in an autonomous culture. According to John Lennox, a mathematician, in one of his lectures he states how we humans are moral beings. Therefore we know and have an understanding to some degree of what is right and wrong and as a result of this, we have the ability to perform these acts. according to "The Machine Questions'' a book that looked over the correlations between intellect machines and ethics, it gives a ver critical perspective with in this topic, as as Rene Descartes, proposed an argument differentiating the two, AI and humans. based on his argument, it covers the hierarchy with the usage of "what" and "who". The book also proposes two classes that give a better understanding of the difference between AI and humans.</em></h4><br>

<h4><em>This therefore brings us to the main question, Who is responsible if an AI performs unethical acts towards us humans?proposing such a question may have no logical background to back it up. as within a western perspective, machines are neither good nor bad. as it has been conceptualized as a tool or an instrument to be used by humans, either it is more or less effective to whatever we are using the tool for. simply using "it wasn't me, it was the computer" is not a valid excuse. however personally i think that such an insite like this will only apply to some degree as AI does not possess the capability of how a human thinks, meaning once AI has the ability to think like us is then we shall apply moral standards to it. However, till this day, the developer can be held accountable for the un-ethical action the AI performs towards humans.</em></h4><br>
