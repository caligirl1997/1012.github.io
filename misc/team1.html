<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>Artificial Intelligence is the future we are constantly told. Do I believe this to be true? Based on the potential opportunities the technology presents to society, I do. Artificial Intelligence will bring together complex concepts into our everyday lives which will improve our overall quality of life. Automation is set to release a huge amount of pressure of people is specific industries which we may see as a detriment initially but will come to find it bring much needed change. A.I. does not receive enough credit for improving many simple aspects of our lives which we take for granted. For example, mapping software run by companies such as Apple and Google are backed by incredible A.I. technology. These apps are constantly criticized for little things like incorrect traffic data but should receive a heap of praise for the shear amount for simplicity they bring to our lives. I hope to see a future where the technology and the people behind it receives the praise it certainly deserves. Despite my positivity however, I would be stupid to ignore the risks and negatives the technology can bring to the table if mishandled.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Who is responsible if A.I. technology performs unethical acts on humans? It’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive answer to this question. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence into various aspects of our everyday lives will mean that many different parties will be involved in one way or another. The moment something goes wrong, fingers will begin to be pointed. Artificial Intelligence is sure to bring many positives which we foresee to outweigh the negatives. The impact of these negatives however, will be far greater than any good that comes of the technology. So how do we measure responsibility if things go wrong, and humans are harmed? </em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Accountability needs to start from the top, with governing bodies. In my opinion, for safety and security reasons, I believe governments will need to regulate how much control we give to A.I. and its decision-making capabilities. For example, situations where someone’s life or livelihood is at risk should not be left up to a decision which an algorithm comes up with. We need to allow room for humans to intervene when necessary, as human instinct will certainly always prevail. </em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Once regulation is in place, engineers and programmers will need to create fool proof algorithms which are able to be overridden when required. Creators of algorithms must not make the mistake of allowing A.I. too much control after creation. Overall control needs to remain with humans. There must be room for humans to step in when harm is inevitable in order to prevent it. Although science fiction loves to entertain the far-fetched scenario of robots taking over the world, this could honestly be a possibility if we provide the technology with too much control over itself. Another thing creators will have to keep in mind is not allowing humans too much control over the technology. For example, a person should not be able to alter the algorithm of an automatic banking or payment system in order to steal money from others. Algorithms will need to be created so that they cannot be altered and misused for malicious intentions by certain people.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>Trust amongst the population will be a huge issue we face. We have essentially created a double-edged sword as we cannot afford to give either side too much leverage over the other. Trust is immeasurable, so the job of the engineers and programmers will be tough with determining how much control that the general population is allocated. This I believe to be the technology’s biggest challenge. Humans do not act on the basis of an algorithm. Most humans have good morals, while there are a few that do not. In the case of Artificial Intelligence, it will only take one bad apple to spoil the bunch. What I mean by that is the future of the technology and its reputation will be completely ruined if someone were to take advantage of the technology’s power to participate in a widespread act with illegal intentions.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>In conclusion, I believe the success of A.I. implementation depends how well we control the technologies limits, as well as how much we choose to trust us people with not misusing. I am a huge advocate for this technology and believe the possibilities we can achieve are honestly endless. The people in positions of power will need to tread carefully and make smart decisions around the technology and make sure we do not push it too far. Furthermore, society will need to take responsibility and ensure the decisions we make with regards to the technology do not cause harm to others. Society as whole will need to work together to ensure that the gift that is A.I. technology will thrive and avoid it’s demise, and maybe even the demise of humanity.</em></h4><br>
