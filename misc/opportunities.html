<h1>Introduction</h1>
</ul><h4><p>Humans are always looking for more efficient ways of completing tasks. There have been four industrial revolutions thus far, and we are currently experiencing the Fourth Industrial Revolution.<p></h4> 
</ul><h4><p>The First Industrial Revolution began in 1760 and ended in 1900. The invention of the steam engine brought about change during this period, enabling rapid urbanisation, efficient and mechanised production.<p></h4> 
</ul><h2><p>The Second Industrial Revolution began in 1900 and ended in 1960.  The invention of the internal combustion engine enabled society to achieve rapid industrialisation by utilising oil and electricity as the fuel for mass production.<p></h4> 
</ul><h2><p>The Third Industrial Revolution began in 1960 and ended in 2000. The invention of computers and robots enabled production to become automated, using electronics and information technology.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution began in 2000. It utilises digital technology producing technological advancements such as big data, Internet of Things (IOT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The speed of innovations occurring during this period can be described as exponential, unlike the other revolutions which can be described as linear.<p></h4> 
</ul><h2><p>The implementation of AI has enabled humans to make great changes in international trade, improvement of social welfare, changes in business model and production mode, and much more.<p></h4>  


</ul><h2><p>Changes in International Trade<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>The growth in international trade can be attributed to the implementation of AI, which has enabled countries to share information mitigating lack of information and trust.<p></h4>
</ul><h4><p>The World Trade Organisation statistics and forecast illustrates that the volume in international trade is estimated to increase by 8% in 2021.<p></h4> 
</ul><h4><p>International trade contributes to economic growth, accelerating the division and specialisation of labour. The innovations in technology have positively impacted the volume in international trade by reducing cross-border transaction costs. These costs will continue to reduce. Countries would be inclined to increase their involvement in international trade if trade costs were lower. It can be seen on the World Bank-ESCAP database that between 1996 and 2014, international trade costs declined by 15%. As a result, trade could potentially increase by 1.8% to 2% annually until 2030. This opens greater opportunities for trade.<p></h4>

</ul><h2><p>Improvement of Social Welfare<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- New technology will create new products and services which will meet higher customer satisfaction standards and also increase demand.<p></h4>
</ul><h4><p>- Match job seekers with employers quicker and more precisely, therefore reducing the impact of frictional unemployment<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>Changes in Business Model and Production Mode<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- Automated machinery is being more commonly integrated to the production process, reducing the failure of physical products caused by automation and control, increasing workplace efficiency.<p></h4>
