<h1>A.I. Risks</h1>


</ul><h2><p>Privacy/Security Breaches<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>Cybersecurity holds huge significance amongst society. It’s been long emphasised that corporations that hold and manage large amounts of people’s personal data are responsible with keeping said data secure and out of harms reach. But what happens when security over our personal data becomes the responsibility of A.I? It is vital that algorithms implemented must be able to withstand alteration and hacks so that immoral actions are not taken with our precious data (Boden, 2016). An example of a potential immoral act is A.I. being used to illegally obtain information (Eg. Credit Card info, addresses) of an individual or company for one’s benefit. <p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>Causing physical harm to humans<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- For example, if a self-driving car were to crash.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>A.I. technology developing excessively to the point where us humans cannot keep up<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- Widespread education of the technology not being sufficient enough to keep up with advancements.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>The algorithms implemented in AI not being completely foolproof.<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- For example, Amazon's AI project in 2019 where the internal recruiting tool quickly developed a bias against women.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>Many work sectors being made redundant due to automation<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>- Automation of jobs such as receptionists and couriers may lead to a future with high unemployment rates.<p></h4>
