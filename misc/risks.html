<h1>A.I. Risks</h1>


</ul><h2><p>Privacy/Security Breaches<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>Cybersecurity holds huge significance amongst society. It’s been long emphasised that corporations that hold and manage large amounts of people’s personal data are responsible with keeping said data secure and out of harms reach. But what happens when security over our personal data becomes the responsibility of A.I? It is vital that algorithms implemented must be able to withstand alteration and hacks so that immoral actions are not taken with our precious data (Boden, 2016). An example of a potential immoral act is A.I. being used to illegally obtain information (Eg. Credit Card info, addresses) of an individual or company for one’s benefit. <p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>Causing physical harm to humans<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>The adoption of self-driving cars has forever been seen as a pipe dream amongst society. But with the technological advancements companies such as Tesla are making, this pipe dream is quickly becoming reality. Despite the technology being so sought after, potentially deadly risks are typically put at the forefront in discussion. The roads are amongst the leading causes of death globally so safety is number one. Driving on the roads is not exactly a matter of accelerating, braking, and indicating. There are many more conditions which drivers must be aware of. With automated technology now jumping into the driver’s seat, developers and manufacturers must ensure that the algorithms in control allow for human-like risk assessment and moral decision making. Algorithms are likely to prioritise fast routes to destinations, but it is crucial that this does not come at the cost of the safety of all drivers on the road (Cunneen et al., 2019).<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>A.I. technology developing excessively to the point where us humans cannot keep up<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>This is a risk which is of strong opinion amongst our group. We believe that the future of A.I. implementation could fall flat if society fails to keep education up to date with each and every advancement which the technology makes. If A.I. is going to be a mainstay and integral part to our future, educating society from younger ages is key. Furthermore, we need to ensure that the content being taught is consistently keeping up with new advancements and findings to ensure sufficient knowledge of the technology is spread amongst the population.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>The algorithms implemented in AI not being completely foolproof.<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>An example of this occurring is an Amazon A.I. recruiting tool which created a bias against women which disadvantaged them with getting a job with the company. This led to the system being scrapped entirely while still in its infancy (Köchling, et al., 2020). The system would assess candidates by comparing their applications with previously submitted applications over the last decade. With Amazon being male dominated, this created a bias towards male applicants at the expense of female applicants. For future application of similar technology, fair algorithms will need to be in place as well as full transparency and testing with every algorithm that is intended for use.<p></h4>
</ul><h2><p>Many work sectors being made redundant due to automation<p></h2>
</ul><h4><p>Many low-skilled job sectors such as receptionists are expected to be made redundant due to automation. This is very likely to affect a large portion of the worlds population. In order to combat this, new job sectors must be created. Thankfully, the possibility for new job creation is predicted to far outweigh the amount of job losses which are foreseen (Vermeulen et al., 2018). This links to a previous risk we’ve stated in a way that society must be far more educated in order to prepare people to take on jobs that never existed before.<p></h4>
